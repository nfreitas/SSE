# Stochastic Single Electronics

A simple python module for the stochastic simulation of electronic circuits at the single electron level. It implements the Gillespie and tau-leaping algorithms. 
It is based on the material presented in this article: https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10578, and it was used to produce some of the results presented there. 
It is just a prototype and has no pretentions of being efficient, or easy to use by other people (some examples are provided, however).

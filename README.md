# Stochastic Single Electronics

A simple python module for the stochastic simulation of electronic circuits at the single electron level.
It is based on the material presented in this article: https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10578, and implements the Gillespie and tau-leaping algorithms.
It is just a prototype and has no pretentions of being efficient, or easy to use by other people (some examples are provided, however).
